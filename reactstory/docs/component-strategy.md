# Component Strategy

## Why Use Wrapper Components?

1. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent styling and behavior across the application.
2. **Abstraction**: Simplifies future changes by abstracting third-party libraries.
3. **Customization**: Allows easy addition of custom logic or styles.

## Example

Here is an example of a wrapper component for the Mantine Button:

```tsx
// filepath: /d:/react18/src/components/MantineV6Components/Button.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button as MantineButton, ButtonProps } from '@mantine/core';

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => {
  return <MantineButton {...props} />;
};

export default Button;
```

By using this approach, you can ensure that all buttons in your application follow the same design and behavior guidelines.

## Performance Impact

Creating wrapper components will have a minimal impact on the performance of your application. The additional layer of abstraction introduced by the wrapper components is lightweight and should not significantly affect the rendering performance. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Minimal Overhead**: The wrapper components are simple functional components that pass props to the underlying Mantine components. This introduces minimal overhead.
2. **Tree Shaking**: Modern bundlers like Vite and Webpack support tree shaking, which removes unused code from the final bundle. This ensures that only the components you use are included in the final build.
3. **Optimization**: React's reconciliation algorithm efficiently updates the DOM, and the additional wrapper components will not hinder this process.

## Ease of Switching Libraries

If you decide to switch to a different component library in the future, such as MUI, you only need to update the wrapper components. The rest of your application code that uses these wrapper components will remain unchanged. For example, to switch the `Button` component from Mantine to MUI, you would update the wrapper component as follows:

```tsx
// filepath: /d:/react18/src/components/MantineV6Components/Button.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button as MUIButton, ButtonProps as MUIButtonProps } from '@mui/material';

type ButtonProps = MUIButtonProps;

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => {
  return <MUIButton {...props} />;
};

export default Button;
```

## Handling Inline Properties

To handle inline properties or custom logic applied directly to components throughout your project, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prop Forwarding**: Ensure that your wrapper components forward all props to the underlying library components. This way, any inline properties will still be applied correctly.

2. **Custom Props**: Define custom props in your wrapper components to handle common inline properties or custom logic. This can help centralize changes when switching libraries.

Example of a wrapper component with custom props:

```tsx
// filepath: /d:/react18/src/components/MantineV6Components/Button.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button as MUIButton, ButtonProps as MUIButtonProps } from '@mui/material';

interface CustomButtonProps extends MUIButtonProps {
  mt?: number;
  flex?: number;
}

const Button: React.FC<CustomButtonProps> = ({ mt, flex, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <MUIButton
      {...props}
      style={{
        marginTop: mt,
        flex: flex,
        ...props.style,
      }}
    />
  );
};

export default Button;
```

By using these strategies, you can minimize the effort required to switch component libraries and ensure that your inline properties and custom logic are consistently applied.
